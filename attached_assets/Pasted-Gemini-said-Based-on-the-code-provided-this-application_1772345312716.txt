Based on the code provided, this application is a custom AI-powered 1-on-1 tutoring platform specifically designed for "personalized business automation education".

It acts as a bridge between a student (named Luke in the prototype) and an instructor (Aleixander), using Google's Gemini AI to automatically structure, refine, and assist with the coursework before and during their live sessions.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what the app is supposed to do, split by the two main user roles:

🎓 1. The Student Experience
The student portal is heavily focused on preparation and personalized curriculum generation.

Goal Setting & Refinement: Before a session starts, the student enters what they want to learn (e.g., "I want to learn how AI can automate my daily workflow").

AI Interaction: Instead of just accepting a vague goal, the app uses an AI Assistant to ask a "single, short, and engaging follow-up question" to force the student to be more specific. Once the student answers, the AI rewrites their goal into a highly actionable learning statement.

Automated Learning Paths: The app takes those refined goals and automatically generates a structured "Learning Path" or agenda for the upcoming session.

👨‍🏫 2. The Instructor Experience
The instructor portal acts as a command center for managing the student's progress and running the live classes.

Session Dashboard: The instructor can see their upcoming 45-minute session with the student, alongside quick metrics like the student's "Engagement" level and "Goals Met".

AI-Generated Agenda: The dashboard displays a pre-built session agenda (e.g., 10m Review, 20m Core Topic, 15m Action Plan) that the AI generated based on the student's earlier inputs.

Live Tools: The instructor has buttons to immediately launch a video meeting ("Start Meeting") or jump into a shared "Workspace".

🤖 3. The Backend AI Engine (gemini.ts)
The true core of the app is its AI capabilities, powered by the gemini-2.5-flash model. Behind the scenes, the app does three main things:

Lesson Planning: It takes the student's text goals and converts them into a structured JSON format containing 3-4 specific focus areas, complete with time durations and learning types (Theory, Practical, Tooling, Discussion).

Automated Code Review: If the student submits Python code (likely through the Workspace or Homework modules), the AI can automatically review it and provide constructive feedback on time complexity or syntax.

Instructor Co-Pilot: The AI acts as a chat assistant explicitly instructed to help the instructor "with lesson plans, AI topics, and homework generation".

In short, it is designed to drastically reduce the administrative and prep work for a tutor, while ensuring the student gets a highly customized lesson tailored specifically to what they need that day.
